**Organization**

The repository contains code files for our work titled “Scalable algorithms for compact low-stretch spanners on real-world graphs". The implementations are built using the PBGL. 

Our work includes implementations of distributed graph algorithms for producing graph spanners under the variants: Baseline, Hybrid Spanner and Sampling Based Algorithms using the adjacency list format and CSR format. The code files (spanner.cpp, bfs1hop.hpp, visitors.hpp) for these variants are located under the appropriate directories. 

**Compilation and Running Code** 

Bring up the PBGL library (refer [https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/graph_parallel/doc/html/index.html])

For a specific implemetation, copy the files from the corresponding folder to PATH/boost_1_82_0/

Compile spanner.cpp and run (refer PBGL setup for details)
